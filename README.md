<h1>AI Automation</h1>

**AI automation** is the use of artificial intelligence to automate tasks and processes that would typically require human intelligence. It combines AI technologies like machine learning and natural language processing with automation to perform intelligent actions, analyze data, and make decisions, going beyond traditional rule-based automation. This approach improves efficiency, accuracy, and productivity, allowing human workers to focus on more strategic work.

In this repository, i will talk about what and why i learn about AI automation and how can you easily implement it in your daily life as well.

**n8n** is an open-source, low-code workflow automation tool that helps users connect applications and services to automate repetitive tasks. It uses a visual, node-based interface for building workflows, but also allows for custom code, making it flexible for both non-technical and technical users.


Its full form is **"Nodemation"** and there are 8 letters seperating n from n so n8n i dont care thats how it was named thats all.

**Disclaimer**: You can download n8n from the their official website https://n8n.io/ but i wanted to try a different approach so please take a note of it:
